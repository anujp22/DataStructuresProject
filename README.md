# Data Structures Fundamentals Project

## Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of data structures through a final class project for a Data Structures course. It involves working with a CSV dataset, applying data cleaning techniques, and implementing C++ code to perform data analysis and handle user-driven queries.

## Key Components

Dataset:

Format: CSV
Cleaning tasks performed: (List specific cleaning tasks here)
C++ Implementation:

Data structures utilized: (List the specific data structures used)
Functionalities:
Data analysis: (Describe the types of data analysis performed)
User input-based queries: (Explain how users can interact with the data)
## Getting Started
